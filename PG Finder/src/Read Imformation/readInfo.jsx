                <p>A common belief is that, for Students & working professionals, Stanza Living is the top PG in Gurgaon. But, as any resident of Stanza Living would tell you, this place is no ordinary . Because they know that no hostel in Gurgaon, be it , or , has professional room cleaning and laundry, customizable meals, and a common area that's absolutely lit. Now, let us guess. You're thinking, what do they call it, if not a Boys & Girls ? They call it their second home.

                Things to Remember while Renting a PG in Gurgaon
                Most folks will tell you many things to remember while renting a Boys & Girls PG in Gurgaon. The first one is rent, which also depends on the area, like Old Gurgaon. Second, comes the question - what does that rent get you in return in that PG hostel? Does the room look like an actual room? Or a storeroom converted into a bedroom?

                Best PG Accommodation in Gurgaon - Stanza Living
                Do you like taking notes? Coz the things you should look for in a PG accommodation in Gurgaon are so many, they are not easy to remember. There used to be a time when just a bed to sleep in, a desk to work/study at, and food to eat were enough. But that was in the year 2000, not the 2020s. This is the 2020s we're talking about. Today, a great boys or girls PG with AC should also have high-speed Wi-Fi, meals you can customize through an app, professional-quality housekeeping, and more. In fact, a great PG today has so much to offer, calling it a "PG" doesn't do it justice. A heavy term like new-age professionally-managed community-living sounds more apt, doesn't it? But of course, there is another name, a not-so-heavy option. And that is Stanza Living.
